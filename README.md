# Zombie-Die
Java Game 

Game Rules
On each turn, randomly generate 3 dice for the game. Each one is a human victim. 
There are 3 different types of die in the game

Red are the toughest. 
(They have 3 Shotguns sides, 2 Footprints sides and 1 Brains side)
Green are the easiest. 
(They have 1 Shotguns side, 2 Footprints sides and 3 Brains sides)
Yellow are medium tough.
(They have 2 Shotguns sides, 2 Footprints sides and 2 Brains sides)

The dice have three symbols:
Brain
You ate your victim’s brain. 
Shotgun
He fought back! 
Footprints
Your victim escaped. 


If you rolled three Shotguns, your turn is over. Otherwise, you can choose to stop and score, or continue. If you decide to stop, score 1 for each Brain you have, and end your turn. It’s the next player’s turn. If you choose to keep going, you reroll the die, but you must keep track of your brains and shotguns. If you are up to 3 Shotguns, your turn is over and you score nothing. Otherwise, you can stop and score, or take another roll…

Footprints are to be kept on the table, what this means is that if you roll a green Footprint you will reroll that dice again. Depending on your luck this can mean that you reroll between 0 – 3 dice in any 1 turn.
